# Project: Automated Audio Download and Transcription

This project consists of two main scripts, `autoAudioDownloader.py` and `transcription.py`, designed to automate the process of downloading audio files from a specified Google Drive folder and transcribing them using the Whisper tool.

## Script Descriptions

### 1. autoAudioDownloader.py

This script is responsible for:
- Authenticating and establishing a connection with the Google Drive API.
- Searching for a specific folder named 'audio' within the Google Drive.
- Downloading all files present in the 'audio' folder to a specified local directory.
- Deleting the files from the Google Drive folder post-download.

### 2. transcription.py

This script performs the following tasks:
- Captures the environment variables and logs them for debugging purposes.
- Changes the working directory to the specified path.
- Identifies all .m4a audio files present in the directory.
- Executes the Whisper command for each audio file to transcribe the audio.
- Stores the transcriptions in a specified output directory.
- Deletes the .m4a files from the directory post-transcription.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Google API client libraries installed (run `pip install --upgrade google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client` to install).
- Whisper tool installed and available in the system's PATH.
- A `credentials.json` file for Google Drive API authentication (obtained from the Google Cloud Console).

### Configuration

- Update the `token_path` and `credentials_path` variables in `autoAudioDownloader.py` with the correct file paths for `token.json` and `credentials.json`.
- Update the `local_folder_path` variable in `autoAudioDownloader.py` with the desired local directory path for downloaded audio files.
- Update the `directory_path` and `whisper_command_template` variables in `transcription.py` with the correct directory path and Whisper command template.

### Execution

1. Run `autoAudioDownloader.py` to download the audio files from Google Drive to the specified local directory:

```bash
python3 /path_to_script/autoAudioDownloader.py
```

2. Run `transcription.py` to transcribe the downloaded audio files using Whisper:

```bash
python3 /path_to_script/transcription.py
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that the Google API client libraries are correctly installed.
- Verify that the `credentials.json` file is accurate and placed in the correct directory.
- Make sure that Whisper is installed and configured correctly, and the specified directory paths exist and are accessible.
- Check the `env_output.txt` file generated by `transcription.py` for any environment-related issues that might affect the script's execution.
